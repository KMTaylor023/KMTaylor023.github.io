The firstflight assignment seems to be an introduction into some of the culture of FOSS. It asked for an introduction, which I apart into a seperate blog [here](https://kmtaylor023.github.io/blog1)

### IRC
IRC is something I used to use a bit when I was younger, mostly to talk to other people who enjoyed playing pokemon on a popular website. SO getting back onto it was a throwback, but not difficult. The name **ref** has been with me forever, so that was an easy nick. The class IRC is reachable via a browser, but I downloaded hexchat anyway to feel more official..

### Email
I believe that we all got an email regarding joining the mailing list outside of this assignment, but I have a bad memory and a habit of deleting possibly important emails (a very destructive combination, I know). **SO** i'm pretty sure I'm good, but my sleep deprived brain has minor doubts..

### Blogging
This, hello! Welcome to my blog. I looked around for easy ways to get a blog up and running on github and found Jekyll, and I must say, it's pretty nice. Just write some markdown in a file and push it to my github and *voila*.

### Forge
I've had a github account for a while, though I don't use it much to be fair. I added an avatar, using some graffiti I found on campus that I thought looked interesting.

### Course Project Patch
For the last part, I forked and cloned the hfoss github. I copied another students yaml file and just edited it to make it my own, then committed and pushed. At the time Of writing, I have not yet done a pull request, but soon.

# Freedom of Expression

On the 29th of january, 2018 (yesterday at the time of writing), [Godot 3.0](https://godotengine.org/) was released. If you haven't heard of Godot (like I hadn't) It's a FOSS game engine. This latest version of the Godot engine apparently pushed it's 3D rendering to a new level, comparable to the likes of Unity and Unreal Engine 4.

Had I the time, I'd love to dive into Godot and make something cool. I don't have that kind of time this semester, but I do have the time to look into what sorts of other FOSS alternatives there are out there to software that I would use to produce a game, and I just wanted to share a bit of what I've found.

### The Alternatives

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is an open source 3D creation sweet, That also has some pretty sweet video editing capabilities built in. It's a great alternative to Maya, which is the autodesk owned software I've used to date to create and rig 3D models.

[Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) is a pretty well known FOSS image manipulation sweet with a lot of powerful capabilities. It can be used as an alternative to photoshop, which I've used to make skins for models in games.

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is another well known piece of FOSSware, used primarily for recording and editing sound. It's great for editing and exporting sounds to the right format. I've actually almost exclusively used Audacity for sound editing (not that I do anything all that intense).

### Other Platforms

Of course, games aren't the only artistic outlet that exist out there. They just happen to be the one I'm most familiar with. I did, however, try to find some Foss alternatives to other programs (mostly adobe) that are used for creating. I won't go into detail on them, I'll just leave a list here:

+ [Openshot](https://www.openshot.org/), a video editor.
+ [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/), used for desktop publishing (like Indesign).
+ [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/), a vector graphics editor
+ [Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/), a photography workflow application

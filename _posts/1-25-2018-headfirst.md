title: FOSS Head First
---

I feel like i've been pretty much thrown head first into a world that I've only, to date, skirted around the edge of. I've had very little exposusre over all.

When I was younger, I used IRC to talk to other gamers on a pokemon website I used to enjoy. SO IRC isn't neccesarily new to me, but I didn't think I would see a comeback of it in my life.

git command line is newer for me, as I've mostly used SourceTree to deal with version control.

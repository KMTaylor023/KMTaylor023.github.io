# Python

Today's post is going to be a short one, as I am very busy this week. I have four projects due and none of them seem to be getting to where I want them to be in any sort of timely manner. One in particular is proving difficult, particularly because it is in python, and i do not (didn't?) know python. Sure, I've seen python before and had a look over some python code, but python is not something I've done any real development in. Now i've been thrust into making a twitter api crawler with it. Oh boy.

See, the one thing that's really bothered me along this journey is that we have to use python 2. I guess there's this huge split between python 2 and python 3 use, and the older python still gets used quite frequently. I guess that's fine, but I have two problems with this. Firstly, if I'm learning a new language, I'd like to only learn the new version of it. Secondly, I've had to be extra cautious about the documentation and stackoverflow answers I've found, to make sure they are referring to python 2 not python 3.

I'm sorry my post so far has been me complaining about my projects and python, but let me say this one last thing. Please use python 3 if you can. Teachers, professionals, hobbyists, and everyone else: Lets get hip with the times.
